## Purpose

The purpose of this project was my introduction to JavaScript. JavaScript is a language that brings functionality to most web pages. It creates a user experience like no other!

## About Project

In this project, I created a game called Robot Gladiators. At the start of the game, the player will be prompted to name their robot. The player will then be initialized with 100 health points, 10 attack points, and 10 money points. The payer's opponent, Roborto, will be initialized with 50 Health points and 12 attack points. The player will have a choice to either fight or run. Of course, running from a fight will cost some money deductions, but its better to pick and choose your fights to survive until the end of the game. Press "Play" below to face the challenge of "Robot Gladiators!"
